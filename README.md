PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. 
You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions

In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
